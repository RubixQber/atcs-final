experimenting with BERT and SQuAD

there's only the python files in here, the saved model and datasets wouldn't fit when i tried to push to github
newtester and squad3.py are the most recent files, tester checks the accuracy of fine-tuned vs original model but i think it's bugged somewhere
squad3.py probably fine-tunes correctly, i have no way to check it with a bugged tester though.
